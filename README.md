# MultiClone App

An advanced Android application enabling seamless multi-profile app management with enhanced virtualization and isolation capabilities.

## Features

- **App Cloning**: Create multiple instances of any installed app
- **Profile Isolation**: Complete data separation between cloned instances
- **Customization**: Custom names and icons for each cloned app
- **No Root Required**: Works without requiring root access
- **Modern UI**: Material 3 design with smooth animations

## Technical Overview

MultiClone App is built using:

- **Kotlin** for Android development
- **MVVM Clean Architecture** for maintainable, testable code
- **Jetpack Compose** for modern, declarative UI
- **Material 3** design system for beautiful visuals
- **Hilt** for dependency injection
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD

## Architecture

The app follows Clean Architecture principles with distinct layers:

### UI Layer
- **Screens**: HomeScreen, AppSelectionScreen, CloneConfigScreen, ClonesListScreen
- **Components**: AppItem, CloneItem, LoadingOverlay
- **ViewModels**: AppSelectionViewModel, CloneConfigViewModel, ClonesListViewModel

### Domain Layer
- **Use Cases**: GetInstalledAppsUseCase, CreateCloneUseCase, GetClonesUseCase, DeleteCloneUseCase, LaunchCloneUseCase
- **Services**: VirtualAppService

### Data Layer
- **Repositories**: AppRepository, CloneRepository
- **Models**: AppInfo, CloneInfo

### Core
- **Virtualization**: VirtualAppEngine, CloneEnvironment, ClonedAppInstaller, VirtualAppManager, CloneProxyActivity, VirtualizationService, CloneManagerService

## Virtualization Technology

MultiClone uses advanced app virtualization to:

1. Create isolated environments for each cloned app
2. Redirect file system access to the isolated environment
3. Manage environment lifecycle through a background service
4. Proxy app launches to load the proper environment

## Recent Implementation Progress

As of April 2025:

- ✅ Completed virtualization core components migration to core package
- ✅ Implemented CloneEnvironment for virtual environment management
- ✅ Created ClonedAppInstaller for handling app installation and updates
- ✅ Enhanced VirtualAppEngine to use the new installer
- ✅ Improved CloneProxyActivity with proper environment setup
- ✅ Added VirtualAppManager for app lifecycle management
- ✅ Created VirtualizationService for background operations
- ✅ Updated repository methods for consistency
